Notes for Aiko Voigt:

 * The ERA5 and ERA5-Land download scripts need to be executed logged in as avoigt to the Masterhub via wolke.img.univie.ac.at. The data will be put in a directory only accessible to avoigt.
 * Then, the data can be copied to `/stufs/lehre/msc-intro-comp-met-ex-w2024/data/`. There, it is accessible to everybody logged in via the Moodle Teachinghub under `LEHRE/msc-intro-comp-met-ex-w2024/data/`.
