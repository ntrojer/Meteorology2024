DONE:
Tried to get the data form the files of Voigt
  -> Changed the path 
Created a plot with the earth map as a subplot 
Researching how to save the data in a netcdf file 
  -> Created functions to download the years and the months 
  -> argument for false and true for data loading (Now for new data: python main.py --new_data)

NEXT:
  * Load data of 1950-1959 and 2000-2009
  * Load monthly data of 2005
  * How to get only one continent?
  * How to get one season?
  * Machine Learning: For one region
  * Plot:
-> PVpot for each month over one year, that we can see how it changes with the seasons (12 plots)-year: 2005 (montly 2.9 GB was big so we should take the annual mean or we try until there is no space for saving anymore)
-> Plot the mean of 1950-1959 and of 2000-2010 (2 plots)
-> Same for all four seasons (8 plots): mean over all years for the seasons
-> Continents (e.g. Antarctica, Europa, Equator)
